-- Bugs  --

Changing the resolution does not work on some devices for yet unknown reasons.
If the program fails to launch due to it not being able to change the screen resolution
to an appropriate value, it will try to change the screen resolution back to the original
value before closing. If this does not work, close the application and change your
screen resolution to the default value specified under Control Panel.

If you would like to edit the database and log in using the login form that is part of the
DB editor and not the main menu, you might experience a bug where even though you have been
logged in, you cannot see the DB's. A temporary workaround is to, close the editor and open 
it again.

-- Error Codes --

0x01 - Program failed to connect to the database even though the database exists.
0x02 - Program failed to connect to the database, which cannot be found.
